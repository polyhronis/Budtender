1. "webapp" - This is the main module that all files are part of. It's the root directory for the application and is shared across all files.

2. "app" - This is the main application object that is likely defined in "webapp/app.py" and used in "webapp/tests/test_app.py" for testing purposes.

3. "test_app" - This is the main testing function or class that is defined in "webapp/tests/test_app.py". It may be used in "webapp/app.py" to run tests.

4. "README.md" - This file likely contains instructions on how to start the webapp, which would be relevant to both "webapp/app.py" (which starts the app) and "webapp/tests/test_app.py" (which tests the app).

5. "start_webapp" - This could be a function defined in "webapp/app.py" that is used to start the webapp. It would be referenced in "webapp/README.md" in the instructions for starting the app.

6. "correct_errors" - This could be a function defined in "webapp/app.py" that is used to correct any mistakes in the webapp. It would be tested in "webapp/tests/test_app.py".

7. "DOM elements" - If the webapp uses JavaScript, there may be shared id names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions use. These would be defined in the HTML templates and used in both "webapp/app.py" and "webapp/tests/test_app.py".

8. "Message names" - If the webapp uses messaging (e.g., for error reporting or user notifications), there may be shared message names. These would be defined in "webapp/app.py" and used in both "webapp/tests/test_app.py" and "webapp/README.md".

9. "Data schemas" - If the webapp uses a database, there may be shared data schemas. These would be defined in "webapp/app.py" and used in "webapp/tests/test_app.py" for testing database interactions.
